# Raspberry pi wardriving web tool

This is a web tool for wardriving with a raspberry pi. CURREENTLY still in very early development.
The reason im making this is to learn js and bootstrap mainly, plus it looks cool and i haven't seen 
many others like it. 

- NO the code is not pretty, i will clean it up later. and NO it does not emit a AP yet, it will be coming in soon updates.
