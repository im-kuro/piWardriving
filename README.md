# Raspberry pi wardriving web tool

This is a web tool for wardriving with a raspberry pi. CURREENTLY still in very early development.
The reason im making this is to learn js and bootstrap mainly, plus it looks cool and i haven't seen 
many others like it. 

- NO the code is not pretty, i will clean it up later. and NO it does not emit a AP yet, it will be coming in soon updates.

## Installation

Clone the repo using git.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/im-kuro/piwardriving
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install libs.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server (please note future installs will be easier)

python run.py
```



## Todo
- [x] clean up analytics page
- [x] finish attack page
